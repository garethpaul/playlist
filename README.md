# playlist

## Overview

`garethpaul/playlist` is a Python web API or service project. The checked-in files describe a Python web API or service project with the structure summarized below.

This README is based on the checked-in source, manifests, scripts, and repository metadata on the `master` branch. The project language mix found during review was: Python (11).

## Repository Contents

- `README.md` - project overview and local usage notes
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependency or packaging metadata
- `app` - source or example code
- `home` - source or example code
- `manage.py`
- `SECURITY.md` - security reporting and disclosure guidance
- `templates` - source or example code
- `VISION.md` - project direction and maintenance guardrails

Additional scan context:

- Source directories: app, home, templates
- Dependency and build manifests: requirements.txt
- Entry points or build surfaces: manage.py
- Test-looking files: home/tests.py

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python matching the era of the project

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garethpaul/playlist.git
cd playlist
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The setup commands above are derived from repository files. Legacy mobile, Python, or JavaScript samples may require older SDKs or package versions than a modern workstation uses by default.

## Running or Using the Project

- Run Django management commands through `python manage.py ...`.

## Testing and Verification

- `python -m pytest` or the test runner used by the files above

When the required SDK or runtime is unavailable, use static checks and source review first, then verify on a machine that has the matching platform toolchain.

## Configuration and Secrets

- Detected references to Twitter. Keep API keys, OAuth credentials, tokens, and account-specific values in local configuration only.

## Security and Privacy Notes

- Review changes touching authentication or token handling; examples from the scan include app/settings.py, app/urls.py, home/views.py, requirements.txt, and 2 more.
- Review changes touching external API calls or credential-adjacent configuration; examples from the scan include app/settings.py, home/views.py, requirements.txt, templates/base.html, and 4 more.
- Review changes touching network requests, sockets, or service endpoints; examples from the scan include app/settings.py, app/urls.py, app/wsgi.py, fabfile.py, and 6 more.
- Review changes touching file, media, JSON, XML, CSV, OCR, or data parsing; examples from the scan include templates/base.html, templates/beats.html, templates/login.html.

## Maintenance Notes

- See `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting and safe research guidance.
- See `VISION.md` for project direction and contribution guardrails.

## Contributing

Keep changes small and tied to the project that is already present in this repository. For code changes, document the toolchain used, avoid committing generated dependency directories or local configuration, and update this README when setup or verification steps change.
